# ROG-JS

A networked dungeon crawler test.

### Introduction

Inspired by tylerc's ROG: https://github.com/tylerc/rog

I saw a problem that tylerc's ROG had a ruby client, making it very difficult to distribute the game. So, my goal is to make a networked dungeon crawler with a Ruby/Sinatra server and a JavaScript client.

Also sicne I'm not good with JavaScript game engines yet, I'm probably going to end up using EaselJS on the client-side. Also I'm still debating whether to use HTTP or Websockets.

Credit to Tyler Church, Nicholas Fernando, and Michael Jerrick for making the original ROG. Although I won't be using any of their code, I'll be using it to learn how it works and how I can implement a similar thing.
